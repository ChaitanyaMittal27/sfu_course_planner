# Coding standards

These are project conventions that prevent regressions across the Spring API, Next.js frontend, and Supabase boundary. They complement [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); existing nearby code remains the style reference for exact details.

## Cross-cutting

- Keep a change within its owning layer. The frontend owns browser UX and readable routes; the backend owns authorization, DTO contracts, and mutations; Supabase owns persisted data and schema constraints.
- Prefer existing shared helpers and boundaries over a second implementation: course routes/resolution, semester utilities, `JwtService`, API clients, and DTOs are the canonical seams.
- Keep secrets and deployment credentials out of source, fixtures, and test output.

## Backend

- Use constructor injection for collaborators. Do not construct HTTP, email, or other external clients inside business methods; expose a small injected boundary instead (for example `RestTemplate` or `EmailTransport`).
- Controllers return `Api*DTO` or `Admin*DTO` values, never JPA entities. Verify Supabase tokens server-side and scope every protected mutation to the authenticated identity.
- Use `SemesterUtil` for backend SFU-term conversions and preserve the current split: PostgreSQL stores catalog data; CourseSys supplies live offering data.
- Treat email, scheduled jobs, and external calls as production-affecting. Make their failure semantics explicit; an attempted provider call is not proof of delivery.

## Tests and validation

- A backend feature or bug fix must include or update focused automated tests in the same change. Test public behavior and error paths, not implementation trivia.
- When a feature changes an API contract, operational behavior, or persistent project convention, update the relevant repository documentation in that same change.
- Use JUnit 5, Mockito, and `@WebMvcTest`/MockMvc as appropriate. Mock Supabase, CourseSys, Resend, repositories, and other external boundaries; unit tests must not require live credentials or network access.
- Run the affected tests while working and `./gradlew test` before handing off a backend change. Run `./gradlew bootJar` for changes that affect production compilation or packaging. The HTML report is `backend/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.
- Test database migrations, RLS, constraints, and native SQL separately against the local Supabase stack; do not pretend mocked Java tests prove database behavior.

## Frontend

- Keep API access in `lib/api.ts`, route construction in `lib/course-routes.ts`, and auth ownership split between `proxy.ts` (guard/refresh) and `AuthContext` (UI state).
- Reuse semantic UI tokens from `app/globals.css`, typography from `app/fonts.ts`, and components from the responsibility-based `components/` folders. Do not introduce page-local color or typography systems.
